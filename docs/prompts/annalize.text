# 🧠 COPILOT — FULL PROJECT ANALYZER & DOCUMENTATION GENERATOR

I want you to scan, understand, and analyze the ENTIRE project codebase in this repository.

Please perform ALL of the following tasks:

---

## 1. 🔍 Detect the Project Type
Identify:

- What kind of project this is (e.g., Auth Microservice, SaaS platform, Learning Portal, Multi-tenant system, API Gateway, Monolith, Microservice, Frontend App, etc.)
- What problem it solves
- The purpose and expected workflows
- The domain it belongs to (education, ecommerce, HR, enterprise SaaS, dev tools, etc.)

---

## 2. 🧱 Detect the Tech Stack & Tools Used
List ALL technologies used in the project:

### Backend
- Framework (Laravel, NestJS, FastAPI, Express, Django, etc.)
- Language/version
- Auth system (JWT, sessions, Passport, NextAuth, etc.)
- Architecture (Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Modular, DDD, microservices)

### Frontend (if present)
- Framework (React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- UI libs (Tailwind, Flowbite, ShadCN, MaterialUI, ChakraUI, etc.)
- Forms, routing, state management

### Database & Storage
- DB type (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- ORMs, migrations, schema structure
- Cache (Redis, local memory, etc.)

### DevOps
- Docker? CI/CD? Pipelines?

### Other Tools Detected
- Logging frameworks
- External services
- Payment, notifications, queues
- Any third-party integrations

---

## 3. ⚙️ Detect Features (Auto-detect from codebase)
Generate a complete list of features, such as:

- Authentication (JWT, refresh tokens, device tracking, lockouts)
- Authorization & RBAC
- Multi-tenancy
- Audit logging
- Email verification
- Password management
- API versioning
- Event-driven logging
- Request validation
- Service providers
- Repositories & interfaces
- Error handling and custom exceptions
- Security layers

Add every feature you find in controllers, services, routes, events, listeners, middleware, and config.

---

## 4. 🧪 Identify Critical Components
Highlight critical areas such as:

- Authentication flows
- Token generation
- Refresh token lifecycle
- User registration flow
- Password reset flow
- Email verification
- Multi-tenant checks
- Legacy migration logic
- Database schema dependencies
- Security-sensitive modules
- Race conditions
- Validation bottlenecks
- Error-handling layers

Explain why these are critical and what could break if misconfigured.

---

## 5. ⚠️ Analyze Pros & Cons of Current Architecture

### PROS:
- Performance strengths
- Scalability
- Security design
- Maintainability
- Clean code practices (if any)
- Testing readiness

### CONS:
- Technical debt
- Bottlenecks in architecture
- Missing validations
- Hard-coded logic
- Poor modularity (if present)
- Security weaknesses
- DB risks (indexes, foreign keys, migrations)

---

## 6. 🛑 Risk Assessment (Best if used for Auth Microservices)
Analyze:

- Attack vectors
- Token invalidation issues
- Multi-tenant risks
- CORS issues
- Session fixation or CSRF possibilities
- Rate limiting gaps
- DB performance hotspots
- Migration conflicts

Provide recommendations.

---

## 7. 📘 Generate Complete Documentation (Markdown)
After analyzing, generate full documentation:

### Include:
1. **Project Overview**
2. **Purpose of the System**
3. **Tech Stack Summary**
4. **Architecture Breakdown**
5. **Feature List**
6. **API Workflow Summary**  
   (Login, Register, Refresh token, Password reset, Email verification, Logout)
7. **Data Flow Diagrams (text-based ASCII)**
8. **Database Schema Overview**
9. **Security Model**
10. **Pros & Cons**
11. **Limitations**
12. **Upgrade Recommendations**
13. **Appendix: Auth Flow Explained Step-by-Step**
14. **Appendix: Migration Strategy (if applicable)**

Format everything nicely in Markdown and generate it as a readable technical document.

---

## 8. 📄 Optional: Generate an Additional File
Create a new file:


and put the fully generated documentation inside it.

---

# Final instruction:
**Wait for the ENTIRE project to finish parsing, then generate all outputs in one clean Markdown document. Do not skip anything.**
